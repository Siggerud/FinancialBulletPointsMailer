# FinancialBulletPointsMailer
This program will send you a mail about the current financial data found at https://markets.businessinsider.com/. I would suggest scheduling this program to run once 
a day if you are interested.

#### How to:

1. Download all files to a folder

2. In the same folder add a .env file

3. **Optional:** Create a new email for sending the emails if you do not have an extra mail

4. To this .env file add the following
```python
SENDER_ADRESS="your.sender.email@yahoo.com"
SENDER_PASSWORD="yourPassword"
RECEIVER="your.receiver.email@aol.com"
```

5. Set the program to run once a day in your scheduling assistant
